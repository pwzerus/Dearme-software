  <p>
    DearMe is a place to document your life on your own terms. 
    You create posts with photos, captions, dates, and tags to build a feed that feels more like a living scrapbook than a social media profile.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead of constantly broadcasting updates to everyone, DearMe is designed to spark real conversations. 
    When you want to share, you can send someone your link to give them <strong><%= FeedShareController::FEED_SHARE_TTL.in_hours %> hour of access</strong> to your feed. 
    They can scroll through what you’ve been up to, and you both have something real to talk about when you’re together.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can add a profile picture by visiting User
    <%= link_to "Account", edit_account_path %>.  
    View your own feed anytime under All
    <%= link_to "Posts", posts_path %>,  
    and check feeds shared with you under Feeds 
    <%= link_to "Shared With Me", shared_user_feeds_path %>.

    <h2>Simple ways to use DearMe</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>After a day out, pick your favorite 1–3 photos and make a single post instead of keeping 30 near-identical shots.</li>
      <li>Use tags for themes that matter to you.</li>
      <li>
        When you meet someone you want to catch up with, share your link using Share 
        <%= link_to "Feed", feed_share_manager_path %> instead of scrolling through your camera roll.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>
      <p>
        Don’t worry about making things perfect. DearMe works best when you quickly capture the moments you actually care about. Not happy with how your post looks? Keep it archived and you can revisit it at a later date to edit it to your liking. View archived posts by changing the filter from posts to archived in the All
        <%= link_to "Posts", posts_path %> section.

      <h2>Been using DearMe already?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep curating: add new posts instead of leaving duplicates buried in your camera roll.</li>
        <li>
          Clean up: use Manage <%= link_to "Tags", tags_path %> to organize or rename your tags.
        </li>
        <li>
          Share in person: use Share <%= link_to "Feed", feed_share_manager_path %> to access your share link which allows other users to view your feed for <%= FeedShareController::FEED_SHARE_TTL.in_hours %>-hour.
        </li>
        <li>
          Check in: browse All <%= link_to "Posts", posts_path %> to revisit what you’ve been up to.
        </li>
        <li>
          Explore: check Feeds <%= link_to "Shared With Me", shared_user_feeds_path %> to see feeds you currently have access to.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Over time, your DearMe feed becomes a clean, searchable history of your life — not a noisy, public timeline.
